###Collectively, all this data has the potential to create vast opportunities in statistical thinking in cricket


<span style="color:green"> User needs to insert **FIVE** (approx) queries on the website to obtain information about performance of **ONE** player  </span>
  
  <span style="color:brown">Limited ways to save those tables efficiently for **comprehensive comparison** of two or more players </span>

##Opening door to more data driven stories for men's and women's cricket

---
  # Package - [CricketData](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cricketdata)
  
  Contains scraper functions for downloading data from ESPNCricinfo into tibbles which can be readily used to analyse the performance of players across different game formats and activities


<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**fetch_cricinfo** </span>    
  To fetch Innings/Career summaries of the players for all countries  


<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**find_player_id**</span>  
  To fetch player id when the user types the name (may be partial) of the player  

<span style="color:MediumVioletRed">**fetch_player_data**</span>  
  To obtain the performance of a player in different formats like TESTS, ODI or T20 and different activities like batting, fielding and bowling using the player id obtained from *find_player_id*
